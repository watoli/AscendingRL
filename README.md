## Introduction

Welcome to AscendingRL, a project dedicated to exploring and advancing the field of Reinforcement Learning (RL). This project is a comprehensive journey that begins with the recreation of classic RL algorithms using Gymnasium, an updated version of the well-known OpenAI Gym library.

Our aim is to provide a clear understanding of the underlying principles and mechanisms of RL algorithms by implementing them step-by-step. This repository will be a living document that not only serves as a tutorial but also as a platform for experimentation and learning.

## Features

- **Reproduction**: Detailed implementations of classic RL algorithms.
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive documentation for each algorithm.
- **Experimentation**: Pre-configured environments for testing and tweaking algorithms.
- **Community**: A place where learners and practitioners can exchange ideas and insights.

## Getting Started

To get started with AscendingRL, you'll need Python installed on your system. We recommend using Python 3.7 or newer versions.

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/AscendingRL.git
   ```

2. Navigate into the directory:
   ```bash
   cd AscendingRL
   ```

3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Algorithms Covered

- Q-Learning
- Deep Q-Networks (DQN)
- Policy Gradients
- Actor-Critic Methods
- Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)
- And more...

Each algorithm is implemented with examples in Gymnasium environments.
